# Was the 2016 US Presidential Election Hacked?
On June 6 2017, an NSA contractor was arrested on suspicion of leaking a top-secret document to The Intercept. The document alleges that Russia attempted to spear-phish election officials in up to seven states. If the Russians were trying to alter vote counts to get Donald Trump elected as president, the American people deserve to know. Is it even possible to detect this kind of interference without having access to the voting machines themselves? To find out, let's start by putting ourselves in the mindset of Vladimir Putin, and assume that he has the capability and determination to pull this off.
## So you want to hack an election
For obvious reasons, you don't want to get caught changing vote tallies. That means Putin can't use any of his usual shenanigans, like bussing people around to multiple voting sites. This effort has got to be more subtle- and that means tampering with electronic voting machines.
