# Were Vote Counts in the 2016 US Presidential Election Hacked?
At this point, you would be forgiven for not wanting to read yet another article about the the Trump-Russia affair.
But in recent days a few things have come to light, revealing that the scope of Putin's campaign of interference was even broader than previously thought. The new revelations are especially troubling because they imply that the Russians didn't just try to influence votes through a sophisticated propaganda machine, but that the very results of the election are in question.
So what are the new revelations?

On June 6 2017, NSA contractor [Reality Winner](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/06/who-is-reality-winner/529266/) was arrested on suspicion of leaking a top-secret document to The Intercept.
The document [alleges](https://theintercept.com/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/) that Russia attempted to spear-phish up to 100 local election officials in up to seven states, with the intention of gaining access to their computer systems.
A week later, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/russian-breach-of-39-states-threatens-future-u-s-elections) reported that Russian hackers had attacked electronic voting infrastructure in up to 39 states. It goes without saying that if the Russians were trying to alter vote counts to get Donald Trump elected as president, the American people deserve to know.
Hopefully law enforcement and intelligence agencies will perform a thorough investigation and make their findings public- but that could take a very long time.

I wondered whether it is possible to detect voting interference without having direct access to the voting machines themselves. To find out, we need to start by putting ourselves in the mindset of Vladimir Putin, and assume that he has the capability and determination to pull this off.
## So you want to hack an election
For obvious reasons, you wouldn't want to get caught changing vote tallies. That means Putin can't use any of his usual shenanigans, like bussing people around to multiple voting sites. This effort has got to be more subtle- and that means tampering with electronic voting machines.
